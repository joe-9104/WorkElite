# WorkElite

***WorkElite*** is a web-based platform developed using **ReactJS** for managing professional tasks, leave requests, and team communication. It is designed to address the challenges faced by IT startups and small businesses by centralizing *task management*, *leave tracking*, and *communication* in one integrated platform.

## Features

### Project Management
- **Create, modify, and delete projects**: Team leaders can manage all aspects of project creation, including assigning tasks to team members.
- **Task management**: Assign tasks to members, define deadlines, priorities, and track their status through a project dashboard.
  
### Leave Management
- **Submit and track leave requests**: Team members can submit leave requests, track their remaining balance, and receive automatic notifications about the status of their request.
- **Admin leave management**: Administrators have access to a detailed dashboard displaying all leave requests and can approve or reject them.

### Communication

- **User profile management**: Both team members and administrators can update and view profile details.

### Authentication & Security
